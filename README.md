### **Overview**
This is my portfolio that I will be updating continuously to improve and refine my skills as I grow as a Software Developer. 

My current skills are in Python 3+, JavaScript ES6+, CSS3, HTML5, SQL, GitHub, MySQL, Kivy, and WordPress. My strongest out of these skills are Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Kivy.

### **Navigation**
The navigation bar will take you to various places on the website except Guides. This is an addition that is planned, but will be slowly updating as I continue to grow. 

### **About Me**
This section is where I have listed a few links to get ahold of me along with a recent picture. This is where I have wrote a tiny summary showing off my passion for developing software.

### **Projects**
This section I have provided screenshots that are also links to interactive projects that I have made.

 However, Piano Chord Progression app will just be directed to my GitHub repository containing the code only. I am currently adding this to Repl and plan on embedding it into my portfolio.

 ### **Contact Me**
 Here is where I have left some extra ways to contact me. I have, also, left an embedded map of what city and state I reside in.
